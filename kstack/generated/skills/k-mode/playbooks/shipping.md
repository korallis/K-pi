**You own what lands. Verify each PR independently, land only the verified run from the root, then keep your hands off the queue.** For "land the stack", "ship it", "enable merge when ready", or the second half of a stack that **Babysit** already drove to green.


2. **Land only the contiguous verified run rooted at the bottom.** Walk up from the lowest unmerged PR and stop at the first one without a passing verdict, where both `PASS` and `PASS+NOTES` pass. A verified PR sitting above an unverified one is not landable, because merging it would pull the gap in underneath it. Report the ceiling as a PR number and say what breaks the chain.
3. **Re-check that the verdicts still describe the code.** A restack rewrites every SHA above it and silently invalidates every verdict without touching a single check. Compare `git patch-id` at the verdict SHA against the current head before trusting an older verdict, and re-verify anything that actually drifted. Twenty-one verdicts went stale this way in one run with no signal at all.
   ```bash
   ```
9. **Stop at the ceiling.** When the verified run is merged, report what landed, what the next unverified PR is, and what verifying it would take. Extending the run is a new pass through step 1, not a judgment call you make at 3am.

**Reply:** the verified run and its ceiling, each PR's verdict and who produced it, what you armed and how you confirmed it, what landed, and what the next gap needs.
